Abstract

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transmit media in
   multimedia telephony applications, these applications are typically
   required to implement congestion control.  The RMCAT working group is
   currently working on candidate algorithms for such interactive real-
   time multimedia applications.  This document describes the test cases
   to be used in the evaluation of the performance of those candidate
   algorithms.

1.  Introduction

   This memo describes a set of test cases for evaluating candidate
   RMCAT congestion control algorithm proposals, it is based on the
   guidelines enumerated in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria] and the
   requirements discussed in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].  The test
   cases cover basic usage scenarios and are described using a common
   structure, which allows for additional test cases to be added to
   those described herein to accommodate other topologies and/or the
   modeling of different path characteristics.  It is the intention of
   this work to capture the consensus of the RMCAT working group
   participants regarding the test cases upon which the performance of
   the candidate RMCAT proposals should be evaluated.

2.  Terminology

   The terminology defined in RTP [RFC3550], RTP Profile for Audio and
   Video Conferences with Minimal Control [RFC3551], RTCP Extended
   Report (XR) [RFC3611], Extended RTP Profile for RTCP-based Feedback
   (RTP/AVPF) [RFC4585], Support for Reduced-Size RTCP [RFC5506], and
   RTP Circuit Breaker algorithm [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers]
   apply.

3.  Structure of Test cases

   All test cases in this document follow a basic structure allowing
   implementers to describe a new test scenario without repeatedly
   explaining common attributes.  The structure includes a general
   description section that describes the test case and motivations,
   additionally it defines a set of attributes that characterize the
   testbed, i.e., the network path between communicating peers and the
   diverse traffic sources.

   o  Define the test case:

      *  General description: describes the motivation and the goals of
         the test case.
      *  Additionally, describe the desired rate adaptation behaviour.
      *  Define a check-list to evaluate the desired behaviour: this
         indicates the minimum set of metrics (e.g., link utilization,
         media sending rate) that a proposed algorithm needs to measure
         to validate the expected rate adaptation behaviour.  It should
         also indicate the time granularity (e.g., averaged over 10ms,
         100ms, or 1s) for measuring certain metrics.  Typical
         measurement interval is 200ms.

   o  Define testbed topology: every test case needs to define an
      evaluation testbed topology.  Figure 1 shows such an evaluation
      topology.  In this evaluation topology, S1..Sn are traffic
      sources, these sources generate media traffic and use either an
      RMCAT candidate congestion control algorithm or use a different
      congestion control algorithm than that one used in the media
      source.  R1..Rn are the corresponding receivers.  A test case can
      have one or more such traffic source (S) and corresponding
      receiver (R). The path from the source to destination is denoted
      as upstream and the path from a destination to a source is denoted
      as downstream.  The following basic structure of test case has
      been described from the perspective of media generating endpoints
      attached on the left-hand side of Figure 1. In this setup media
      flows in upstream direction and corresponding control messages
      flows in the downstream direction.  However, it is possible to
      have media flows in the both upsteam and downsteam direction.  In
      that case it is expected that the downstream path does not
      introduce any impairments and has enough capacity to accomodate
      both media and control messages.  It should be noted that
      depending on test cases It is possible to have different path
      characteristics in either directions.

   In a laboratory testbed environment there exists large amount of
   traffic on the network path between the endpoints, which may be
   contributed by other devices connected to such a testbed.  It is
   recommended to not route non-test traffic through the testbed.
   o  Define testbed attributes:

      *  Duration: defines the duration of the test.
      *  Path characteristics: defines the end-to-end transport level
         path characteristics of the testbed in a particular test case.
         Two sets of attributes describes the path characteristics, one
         for the upstream path and the other for the downstream path.
         The path characteristics for a particular path direction is
         applicable to all the Sources "S" sending traffic on that path.
         If only one attribute is specified, it is used for both path
         directions.

         +  Path direction: upstream or downstream.
         +  Bottleneck-link capacity: defines minimum capacity of the
            end-to-end path
         +  One-way propagation delay: describes the end-to-end latency
            along the path when network queues are empty i.e., the time
            it takes for a packet to go from the sender to the receiver,
            it does not include any queuing delay.
         +  Maximum end-to-end jitter: defines maximum jitter can be
            observed along the path.

            PIE.
         +  Bottleneck queue size: defines size of queue in terms of
            queuing time when the queue is full (in milliseconds).
         +  Path loss ratio: characterize the non-congested losses
            observed on the end-to-end path.  MUST describe the loss
            pattern or loss model.
      *  Application-related: defines the traffic source behaviour for
         implementing the test case

         +  Media traffic Source: defines the characteristics of the
            media sources present.  When using more than one media
            source, the different attributes are enumerated separately
            for each different media source.

            -  Media type: Video/Voice/Application/Text
            -  Media flow direction: upstream, downstream or both.
            -  Number of media sources: defines the total number of
               media sources
            -  Media codec: Constant Bit Rate (CBR) or Variable Bit Rate
               (VBR)
            -  Media source behaviour: describes the media encoder
               behavior.  It MUST define the main parameters that affect
               the adaptation behaviour.  This may include but not
               limited to:

               o  Adaptability: describes the adaptation options.  For
                  example, in case of video it defines the range of
                  bitrate adaptation, frame rate adaptation, video
                  resolution adaptation.  In case of voice, it defines

               o  Output variation : for VBR encoder, it defines the
                  encoder output variation from the average target rate.
                  For example on average the encoder output may vary
                  between 5% to 15% above or below the average target
                  bit rate.
               o  Encoder's responsiveness to a new bit rate request:
                  value typically between 10ms to 1000ms.
            -  Media content: describes the chosen media sequences; For
               example, test sequences are available at: [xiph-seq]
               [HEVC-seq].

            -  Media timeline: describes the point when the media source
               is introduced and removed from the testbed.  For example,
               the media source may begin transmitting when the test
               case begins or a few seconds after, etc.
            -  Startup behaviour: the media starts at a defined bit
               rate, which may be the minimum, maximum bit rate, or a
               value in between (in Kbps).
         +  Competing traffic source: describes the characteristics of
            the competing traffic source, the different types of
            competing flows are enumerated in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-
            criteria].

            -  Traffic direction: Upstream, downstream or both.
            -  Type of sources: defines the types of competing traffic
               sources.  Types of competing traffic flows are listed in
               [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].  For example, the number
               of TCP flows connected to a web browser, the mean size
               and distribution of the content downloaded.
            -  Number of sources: defines the total number of competing
               sources of each type.
            -  Congestion control: enumerate the congestion control used
               by each type of competing traffic.
            -  Traffic timeline: describes when the competing traffic is
               added and removed from the test case.
      *  Additional attributes: describes attributes essential for
         implementing a test case which are not included in the above
         structure.  These attributes MUST be well defined, so that
         other implementers are able to implement it.

   Any attribute can have a set of values (enclosed within "[]"). Each
   member value of such a set MUST be treated as different value for the
   same attribute.  It is desired to run separate tests for each such
   attribute value.

   The test cases described in this document follow the above structure.

4.  Recommended Evaluation Settings

   This section describes recommended test case settings and could be
   overwritten by the respective test cases.

4.1.  Evaluation metircs

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   at a fine enough time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

       a.  End-to-end delay for the RMCAT flow.
       b.  Packet losses observed at the receiving endpoint
       c.  Feedback message overhead
       d.  Convergence time.
   2.  Transport level:

           +  median, maximum, minimum

4.2.  Path characteristics

   Each path between a sender and receiver as described in Figure 1 must
   have the following characteristics unless different settings are
   described in a particular test case.

   o  Path direction: Upstream and Downstream.
   o  Bottleneck-link capacity: 4Mbps.
   o  One-Way propagation delay: 50ms.  It is encouraged to tests with
      additional propagation delays mentioned in Appendix Appendix A.1
   o  Maximum end-to-end jitter: 30ms.
   o  Bottleneck queue type: Drop tail.  Additional tests with other AQM
      schemes are recommended: FQ-CoDel, PIE.
   o  Bottleneck queue size: 300ms.
   o  path loss ratio: 0%.

   Examples of addional network parameters are discussed in Appendix
   Appendix A.

4.3.  Media source

   Each test case will include one or more media sources as described
   below.  If a particular test case requires different media source
   behavior then that will be described in the respective test case.

            -  Bit rate range: 150 Kbps - 1.5 Mbps.  In real-life
               application the bitrate range can vary a lot depeding on
               the provided service, for example, the maximum bitrate
               can be up to 4Mbps.  However, for running tests to
               evaluate the congestion control algorithms it is more
               important to have a look at how they are reacting to

               that the media traffic generator used in a particular
               simulator or testbed if not capable of generating higher
               bitrate.  Hence we selected a suitable bitrate range for
               most of applications to achieve and designed the test
               cases accordingly.  If other bitrate range is used in the
               test cases than the mentined the corresponding media
               timeline, path capacity variation also need to be scalced

5.  Basic Test Cases

5.1.  Variable Available Capacity with single RMCAT flow

   In this test case the bottleneck-link capacity between the two
   endpoints varies over time.  This test is designed to measure the
   responsiveness of the candidate algorithm.  This test tries to
   address the requirement 1(a) in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements],
   which requires the algorithm to adapt the flow(s) and provide lower
   end-to-end latency when there exists:

   o  an intermediate bottleneck
   o  change in available capacity due to interface change and/or
      routing change.

   o  maximum Media Bit Rate is Greater than Link Capacity.  In this
      case, the application will attempt to ramp up to its maximum bit
      rate, since the link capacity is limited to a value lower, the
      congestion control scheme is expected to stabilize the sending bit
      rate close to the available bottleneck capacity.  This situation
      can occur when the endpoints are connected via thin long networks
      even though the advertised capacity of the access network may be
      higher.  The test case addresses the requirement 1 and 10 of the
      [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   It should be noted that the exact variation in available capacity due
   to any of the above depends on the under-lying technologies.  Hence,
   we describe a set of known factors, which may be extended to devise a
   more specific test case targeting certain behaviour in a certain
   network environment.

   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm is expected to detect the
   path capacity constraint, converges to bottleneck link's capacity and
   adapt the flow to avoid unwanted oscillation when the sending bit
   rate is approaching the bottleneck link's capacity.  The oscillations
   occur when the media flow(s) attempts to reach its maximum bit rate,
   overshoots the usage of the available bottleneck capacity, to rectify
   it reduces the bit rate and starts to ramp up again.

   Testbed topology: One media source S1 is connected to corresponding
   R1. The media traffic is transported over the upstream path and
   corresponding feedback/control traffic is transported over the
   downstream path.

5.2.  Variable Available Capacity with multiple RMCAT flows

   This test case is similar to Section 5.1. However in addition this
   test will also consider persistent network load due to competing
   traffic.

   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithms is expected to detect the
   variation in available capacity and adapt the media stream(s)
   accordingly.  The flows stabilize around their maximum bitrate as the
   as the maximum link capacity is large enough to accommodate the
   flows.  When the available capacity drops, the flow(s) adapts by
   decreasing its sending bit rate, and when congestion disappears, the
   flow(s) are again expected to ramp up.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the metrics described
   in Section 4.1 at a fine enough time granularity:

   Testbed Topology: Two (2) media sources S1 and S2 are connected to
   their corresponding R1 and R2. The media traffic is transported over
   the upstream path and corresponding feedback/control traffic is
   transported over the downstream path.

5.3.  Congested Feedback Link

   RMCAT WG has been chartered to define algorithms for RTP hence it is
   assumed that RTCP, RTP header extension or such would be used as
   signalling means for the adaptation algorithm in the backchannel.
   Due to asymmetry nature of the link between communicating peers it is
   possible to observer lack such backchannel information due to
   impaired backchannel link (even when forward channel might be
   unimpaired). This test case is designed to observer candidate
   congestion control behaviour in such an event.  This test case
   addresses requirement number 5 and in particular, requirement number
   7.

   It is expected that the candidate algorithms should cope with the
   lack of backchannel information and adapt to minimize the performance
   degradation of media flows in the forward channel.

   It SHOULD be noted that for this test case log is needed for the
   reference case where the downstream channel has no impairments

5.4.  Competing Flows with same RMCAT Algorithm

   In this test case, more than one RMCAT media flow shares the
   bottleneck link and each of them uses the same congestion control
   algorithm.  This is a typical scenario wherein a real-time
   interactive application sends more than one media flows to the same
   destination and these flows are multiplexed over the same port.  In
   such a scenario it is likely that the flows will be routed via the
   same path and need to share the available bandwidth amongst
   themselves.  For the sake of simplicity it is assumed that there are
   no other competing traffic sources in the bottleneck link and that
   there is sufficient capacity to accommodate all the flows
   individually.  While this appears to be a variant of the test case
   defined in Section 5.2 , however it tests the capacity sharing
   distribution of the candidate algorithm.  Whereas, the previous test
   case measures the stability and responsiveness of the candidate
   algorithm.  This test case particularly addresses the requirements
   2,3 and 10 in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Expected behavior: It is expected that the competing flows will
   converge to an optimum bit rate to accommodate all the flows with
   minimum possible latency and loss.  Specifically, the test introduces
   three media flows at different time instances, when the second flow
   appears there should still be room to accommodate another flow on the
   bottleneck link.  Lastly, when the third flow appears the bottleneck
   link should be saturated.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   in addition to the metrics described in Section 4.1 at a fine enough
   time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

       1.  Variation in sending bit rate and goodput.  Mainly observing
           the frequency and magnitude of oscillations.
       2.  Convergence time.
       3.  Feedback message overhead.

   Testbed topology: Three media sources S1, S2, S3 are connected to
   respective R1, R2, R3. The media traffic is transported over the
   upstream path and corresponding feedback/control traffic is
   transported over the downstream path.

5.5.  Round Trip Time Fairness

   In this test case, more than one RMCAT media flow shares the
   bottleneck link, but the end-to-end path latency for each RMCAT flow
   is different.  For the sake of simplicity it is assumed that there
   are no other competing traffic sources in the bottleneck link and
   that there is sufficient capacity to accommodate all the flows.
   While this appears to be a variant of the test case 4.2, it tests the
   capacity sharing distribution of the candidate algorithm under
   different RTTs.  This test case particularly addresses the
   requirements 2 [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   It is expected that the competing flows will converge to an optimum
   bit rate to accommodate all the flows with minimum possible latency
   and loss.  Specifically, the test introduces five media flows at the
   same time instance.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the metrics described

5.6.  RMCAT Flow competing with a long TCP Flow

   In this test case, one or more RMCAT media flow shares the bottleneck
   link with at least one long lived TCP flows.  Long lived TCP flows
   download data throughout the session and are expected to have
   infinite amount of data to send and receive.  This is a scenario
   wherein a multimedia application co-exists with a large file
   download.  The test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate
   algorithm to competing traffic, it addresses the requirement 8 in
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Expected behavior: depending on the convergence observed in test case
   4.1 and 4.2, the candidate algorithm may be able to avoid congestion
   collapse.  In the worst case, the media stream will fall to the
   minimum media bit rate.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   in addition to the metrics described in Section 4.1 at a fine enough
   time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

       a.  Variation in sending bit rate and goodput.  Mainly observing
           the frequency and magnitude of oscillations.
       b.  Variation in the sending rate of the TCP flow
       c.  TCP throughput.

   Testbed topology: One (1) media source S1 is connected to
   corresponding R1, but both endpoints are additionally receiving and
   sending data, respectively.  The media traffic (S1->S2) is
   transported over the upstream path and corresponding feedback/control
   traffic is transported over the downstream path.  Likewise media
   traffic (S2->S1) is transported over the downstream path and
   corresponding feedback/control traffic is transported over the
   upstream path.  The TCP uploads traffic over upstream path and
   downloads over downstream path.  Hence, TCP traffic exits in both
   path directions.

5.7.  RMCAT Flow competing with short TCP Flows

   In this test case, one or more RMCAT media flow shares the bottleneck
   link with at multiple short-lived TCP flows.  Short-lived TCP flows
   resemble the on/off pattern observed in the web traffic, wherein
   clients (browsers) connect to a server and download a resource
   (typically a web page, few images, text files, etc.) using several
   TCP connections (up to 4). This scenario shows the performance of the
   multimedia application when several browser windows are active.  The
   test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate algorithm to
   competing web traffic, it addresses the requirements 2 in [I-D.ietf-
   rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Depending on the number of short TCP flows, the cross-traffic either
   appears as a short burst flow or resembles a long TCP flow.  The
   intention of this test is to observe the impact of short-term burst
   on the behaviour of the candidate algorithm.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   in addition to the metrics described in Section 4.1 at a fine enough
   time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

   transported over the upstream path and corresponding feedback/control
   traffic is transported over the downstream path.  Likewise media
   traffic (S2->S1) is transported over the downstream path and
   corresponding feedback/control traffic is transported over the
   upstream path.  The TCP uploads traffic over upstream path and
   downloads over downstream path.  Hence, TCP traffic exits in both
   path directions.  The topology described here is similar to the one
   described in Figure 6.

            See test specific setup.  Not all short TCPs start at the
            same time, 2 start in the ON state while 8 start in an OFF
            stats.  The model for the idle times for the OFF state is
            discussed in the Short-TCP model.

      *  Short-TCP traffic model:

         +  File sizes: uniform distribution between 100KB to 1MB
         +  Idle period: the duration of the OFF state is derived from
            an exponential distribution with the mean value of 10
            seconds.

5.8.  Media Pause and Resume

   In this test case, more than one real-time interactive media flows
   share the link bandwidth and all flows reach to a steady state by
   utilizing the link capacity in an optimum way.  At these stage one of
   the media flow is paused for a moment.  This event will result in
   more available bandwidth for the rest of the flows and as they are on
   a shared link.  When the paused media flow will resume it would no
   longer have the same bandwidth share on the link.  It has to make it
   way through the other existing flows in the link to achieve a fair
   share of the link capacity.  This test case is important specially
   for real-time interactive media which consists of more than one media
   flows and can pause/resume media flow at any point of time during the
   session.  This test case directly addresses the requirement number
   1.B in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].  One can think it as a
   variation of test case 4.3. However, it is different as the candidate
   algorithms can use different strategies to increase it s efficiency,
   for example the fairness, convergence time, reduce oscillation etc,
   by capitalizing the fact that they have previous information of the
   link.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   in addition to the metrics described in Section 4.1 at a fine enough
   time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

       a.  Variation in sending bit rate and goodput.  Mainly observing
           the frequency and magnitude of oscillations.

Appendix A.  List of Network Parameters

   In addition to the recommended evaluation settings in Section Section
   4, the implemntors can extend their tests by choosing from the
   following values:

Appendix A.1.  One-way propagation delay

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT                May 2014


   The end-to-end latency corresponds to the propagation delay of the
   path, i.e., the time it takes for a packet to traverse the path
   connecting the sender to the receiver, it does not include queuing
   delay.  Experiments are expected to verify that the congestion
   control is able to work in challenging situations, for example over
   trans-continental and/or satellite links.  Typical values are:

   1.  Very low latency: 0-1ms
   2.  Low latency: 50ms
   3.  High latency: 150ms
   4.  Extreme latency: 300ms

Appendix A.2.  End-to-end Loss

   To model lossy links, the experiments can choose one of the following
   loss rates, the fractional loss is the ratio of packets lost and
   packets sent.

   1.  no loss: 0%
   2.  1%
   3.  5%
   4.  10%
   5.  20%

Appendix A.3.  DropTail Router Queue Length

   The router queue length is measured as the time taken to drain the
   FIFO queue.  It has been noted in various discussions that the queue
   length in the current deployed Internet varies significantly.  While
   the core backbone network has very short queue length, the home
   gateways usually have larger queue length.  Those various queue
   lengths can be categorized in the following way:

   1.  QoS-aware (or short): 70ms
   2.  Nominal: 300-500ms
   3.  Buffer-bloated: 1000-2000ms

   Here the size of the queue is measured in bytes or packets and to
   convert the queue length measured in seconds to queue length in
   bytes:

   QueueSize (in bytes) = QueueSize (in sec) x Throughput (in bps)/8

Appendix B.  Models

Appendix B.1.  Jitter model

   [Editor's note :We recommend that while using network simulator or
   immulator the jitter model uses a FIFO describes model for creating
   jitter.  Following psuodo code descriobes the recomented jitter
   model.  For, example, random jitter based on uniform distribution]

   [Editor's note : Describes the model for generating packet losses,
   for example, losses can be generated using traces, or using the
   Gilbert-Elliot model, or randomly (uncorrelated loss).]

Appendix B.3.  TCP taffic model

   Long-lived TCP flows will download data throughout the session and
   are expected to have infinite amount of data to send or receive.

   Each short TCP flow is modeled as a sequence of file downloads
   interleaved with idle periods.  Not all short TCPs start at the same
   time, i.e., some start in the ON state while others start in the OFF
   state.

   The short TCP flows can be modelled in two ways, 1) 100s of flows
   fetching small (5-20 KB) amounts of data, or 2) 10s of flows fetching
   slightly larger (100-1000KB) amounts of data.

   The idle period is typically derived from an exponential distribution
   with the mean value of 10 seconds.

   [Open issue: short-lived/bursty TCP cross-traffic parameters are
   still to be agreed upon.
