    <abstract>
      <t>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transmit media in
      multimedia telephony applications, these applications are typically
      required to implement congestion control. The RMCAT working group is
      currently working on candidate algorithms for such interactive real-time
      multimedia applications. This document describes the test cases to be
      used in the evaluation of the performance of those candidate
      algorithms.</t>

      <!--The draft defines a structure on how to define test cases and uses
	  that stracture to define test case those are essensial to RMCAT to evaluate
	  the candidate algorithms. also the intention here is define the test cases
	  in such a way that people can customize by tunning the same test case to fit
	  their to be tested network characteristics. this is the theme and we need
	  more text here.-->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This memo describes a set of test cases for evaluating candidate
      RMCAT congestion control algorithm proposals, it is based on the
      guidelines enumerated in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria"></xref> and the requirements
      discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements"></xref>. The
      test cases cover basic usage scenarios and are described using a common
      structure, which allows for additional test cases to be added to those
      described herein to accommodate other topologies and/or the modeling of
      different path characteristics. It is the intention of this work to
      capture the consensus of the RMCAT working group participants regarding
      the test cases upon which the performance of the candidate RMCAT
      proposals should be evaluated.</t>

    <section anchor="TS" title="Structure of Test cases">
      <t>All test cases in this document follow a basic structure allowing
      implementers to describe a new test scenario without repeatedly
      explaining common attributes. The structure includes a general
      description section that describes the test case and motivations,
      additionally it defines a set of attributes that characterize the
      testbed, i.e., the network path between communicating peers and the
      diverse traffic sources.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Define the test case: <list style="symbols">
              <t>General description: describes the motivation and the goals
              of the test case.</t>

              <t>Expected behavior: describe the desired rate adaptation
              behaviour.</t>

              <t>Define a check-list to evaluate the desired behaviour: this
              indicates the minimum set of metrics (e.g., link utilization,
              media sending rate) that a proposed algorithm needs to measure
              to validate the expected rate adaptation behaviour. It should
              also indicate the time granularity (e.g., averaged over 10ms,
              100ms, or 1s) for measuring certain metrics. Typical measurement
              interval is 200ms.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Define testbed topology: every test case needs to define an
          evaluation testbed topology. <xref target="fig-eval-topo"></xref>
          shows such an evaluation topology. In this evaluation topology,
          S1..Sn are traffic sources. These sources generate media traffic and
          use either an RMCAT candidate congestion control algorithm or other
          congestion control algorithm designed for media, such as TFRC.
          R1..Rn are the corresponding receivers. A test case can have one
          or more such traffic sources (S) and corresponding receivers (R).
          The path from the source to destination is denoted as forward and
          the path from a destination to a source is denoted as backward.
	  The following basic structure of test case has been described from
          the perspective of media generating endpoints attached on the
          left-hand side of <xref target="fig-eval-topo"></xref>. In this setup,
          media flows in forward direction and corresponding feedback/control
          messages flow in the backward direction. However, it is also possible
          to set up the test with media flowing in both forward and backward
          directions. In that case, unless otherwise specified by the test case,
          it is expected that the backward path does not introduce any impairments
          and has enough capacity to accomodate both media and feedback/control
          messages. It should be noted that depending on test cases it is
          possible to have different path characteristics in either directions.</t>

	    </figure>In a laboratory testbed environment there may
	    exist a significant amount of traffic on portions of the
	    network path between the endpoints that is not desired for
	    the purposes of these RMCAT tests.
	    Some of this traffic may be generated by other processes on the endpoints
	    themselves (e.g., discovery protocols) or by other endponts not presently
	    under test.
	    It is recommended not to route traffice generated by endpoints that are
	    not under test through the test bed.
	    Additionally, it is recommended to route non-RMCAT traffic generated by
	    the endpoints under test around the bottleneck links specified herein.</t>

        <t>In this test case the bottleneck-link capacity between the two
        endpoints varies over time. This test is designed to measure the
        responsiveness of the candidate algorithm. This test tries to address
        the requirement 1(a) in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements"></xref>, which requires the
        algorithm to adapt the flow(s) and provide lower end-to-end latency
        when there exists: <list style="symbols">
            <t>an intermediate bottleneck</t>

            <t>change in available capacity (e.g., due to interface change,
		    routing change).</t>

            <t>maximum Media Bit Rate is Greater than Link Capacity. In this
            case, the application will attempt to ramp up to its maximum bit
            rate, since the link capacity is limited to a value lower, the
            congestion control scheme is expected to stabilize the sending bit
            rate close to the available bottleneck capacity. This situation
            can occur when the endpoints are connected via thin long networks
            even though the advertised capacity of the access network may be
            higher. The test case addresses the requirement 1 and 10 of the
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements"></xref>.</t>
	    
	    <!-- XZ: the above text may need to be removed? -->

          </list>It should be noted that the exact variation in available
        capacity due to any of the above depends on the under-lying
        technologies. Hence, we describe a set of known factors, which may be
        extended to devise a more specific test case targeting certain
        behaviour in a certain network environment.</t>

        <t>Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm is expected to detect
        the path capacity constraint, converges to bottleneck link's capacity
        and adapt the flow to avoid unwanted oscillation when the sending bit
        rate is approaching the bottleneck link's capacity. The oscillations
        occur when the media flow(s) attempts to reach its maximum bit rate,
        overshoots the usage of the available bottleneck capacity, to rectify
        it reduces the bit rate and starts to ramp up again.</t>

        <t>Testbed topology: One media source S1 is connected to corresponding
        R1. The media traffic is transported over the forward path and
        corresponding feedback/control traffic is transported over the
        backward path.

               title="Competing Flows with Same RMCAT Algorithm">
        <t>In this test case, more than one RMCAT media flow shares the
        bottleneck link and each of them uses the same congestion control
        algorithm. This is a typical scenario where a real-time interactive
        application sends more than one media flows to the same destination
        and these flows are multiplexed over the same port. In such a scenario
        it is likely that the flows will be routed via the same path and need
        to share the available bandwidth amongst themselves. For the sake of
        simplicity it is assumed that there are no other non-RMCAT competing
	traffic sources in the bottleneck link and that there is sufficient
	capacity to accommodate all the flows individually. While this appears
	to be a variant of the test case defined in <xref target="VACM"></xref>,
        it focuses on the capacity sharing aspect of the candidate algorithm.
	The previous test case, on the other hand, measures adaptability, stability, 
	and responsiveness of the candidate algorithm. This test case particularly
        addresses the requirements 2,3 and 10 in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Expected behavior: It is expected that the competing flows will
        converge to an optimum bit rate to accommodate all the flows with
        minimum possible latency and loss. Specifically, the test introduces
        three media flows at different time instances, when the second flow
        appears there should still be room to accommodate another flow on the
        bottleneck link. Lastly, when the third flow appears the bottleneck
        link should be saturated.</t>

        <t>To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
        expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
        in addition to the metrics described in <xref target="EM"></xref> at a
        fine enough time granularity: <list style="numbers">

        flows download data throughout the session and are expected to have
        infinite amount of data to send and receive. This is a scenario
        where a multimedia application co-exists with a large file download.

        competing traffic. It addresses the requirement 8 in <xref

        <t>Expected behavior: depending on the convergence observed in test
        case 5.1 and 5.2, the candidate algorithm may be able to avoid
        congestion collapse. In the worst case, the media stream will fall to
        the minimum media bit rate.</t>

      <section title="RMCAT Flow competing with short TCP Flows">
        <t>In this test case, one or more RMCAT media flow shares the
        bottleneck link with at multiple short-lived TCP flows. Short-lived
        TCP flows resemble the on/off pattern observed in the web traffic,
        wherein clients (browsers) connect to a server and download a resource
        (typically a web page, few images, text files, etc.) using several TCP
        connections (up to 4). This scenario shows the performance of the
        multimedia application when several browser windows are active. The
        test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate algorithm to
        competing web traffic, it addresses the requirements 2 in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Depending on the number of short TCP flows, the cross-traffic
        either appears as a short burst flow or resembles a long TCP flow. The
        intention of this test is to observe the impact of short-term burst on
        the behaviour of the candidate algorithm.</t>

        <t>To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
        expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics

      <section title="Media Pause and Resume">
        <t>In this test case, more than one real-time interactive media flows
        share the link bandwidth and all flows reach to a steady state by
        utilizing the link capacity in an optimum way. At these stage one of
        the media flow is paused for a moment. This event will result in more
        available bandwidth for the rest of the flows and as they are on a
        shared link. When the paused media flow will resume it would no longer
        have the same bandwidth share on the link. It has to make it way
        through the other existing flows in the link to achieve a fair share
        of the link capacity. This test case is important specially for
        real-time interactive media which consists of more than one media
        flows and can pause/resume media flow at any point of time during the
        session. This test case directly addresses the requirement number 1.B
        in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements"></xref>. One can
        think it as a variation of test case 5.3. However, it is different as
        the candidate algorithms can use different strategies to increase its
        efficiency, for example the fairness, convergence time, reduce
        oscillation etc, by capitalizing the fact that they have previous
        information of the link.</t>

    <section title="Other potential test cases">
      <t>It has been noticed that there are other interesting test cases
      besides the basis test cases listed above. In many aspects, these
      additional test cases can help to further evaluate the candidate
      algorithm. They are listed as below. </t>

      <section title="Explicit Congestion Notification Usage">
        <t>This test case requires to run all the basic test cases with the
        availability of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) feature
        enabled. The goal of this test is to exibit that the candidate
        algorithms does not fail when ECN signals are available.</t>

      <section title="Multiple Bottlenecks">
        <t>In this test case three RMCAT flows traverse a multi-hop
        network. As illustrated in <xref target="fig-eval-topo-6-2"></xref>, 
        the first flow competes with the second flow over the first
        bottleneck link on the sender side; it competes with the 
        third flow over the second bottleneck link on the reciever
        side. The goal of this test is to ensure that the candidate
        algorithms work properly in the presence of multiple bottlenecks.

       <t>Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm is expected to achieve
       full utilization at both bottleneck links without starving any of the

	  ?	AP handover- causing interruption in communication, change in available bandwidth, delay and loss, restart of new session.
	  ?	Congested AP- causing race condition for medium access and leading to buffer overflow, loss and delay.
	  ?	Hidden node / exposed node problem- causing unnecessary error in transmission leading to low packet rate over radio and such. 
	  However with modern RTS/CTS the situation is much improved.
	  It is analyzed how Wi-Fi is used then we can see there is basically three kind of access setup, for simplicity only two 
	  endpoints are considered here, ? 1) all the endpoint connected over WiFi to same AP (no internet in between), 2) two endpoints 
	  are connected over WiFi to two different access point (AP points may be connected over the Internet), 3) one endpoint is 
	  connected over WiFi and another endpoint is connected to the Internet over any other access type than WiFi.    
	  It is always encouraged to device test cases with real or simulated Wi-Fi access. However, considering a limited mobility
	   pattern and effect of the events in Wi.FI network a care full investigation may lead to devise a variation of general 
	  test cases to evaluate the performance of congestion control algorithms. Hence this section is TBD.

        <t>The end-to-end latency corresponds to the propagation delay of the

        connecting the sender to the receiver, it does not include queuing
        delay. Experiments are expected to verify that the congestion control
        is able to work in challenging situations, for example over
        trans-continental and/or satellite links. Typical values are: <list

      <section anchor="scen-queue" title="DropTail Router Queue Length">
        <t>The router queue length is measured as the time taken to drain the
        FIFO queue. It has been noted in various discussions that the queue
        length in the current deployed Internet varies significantly. While
        the core backbone network has very short queue length, the home
        gateways usually have larger queue length. Those various queue lengths
        can be categorized in the following way: <list style="numbers">
            <t>QoS-aware (or short): 70ms</t>

            <t>Nominal: 300-500ms</t>

            <t>Buffer-bloated: 1000-2000ms</t>
          </list> Here the size of the queue is measured in bytes or packets
        and to convert the queue length measured in seconds to queue length in
        bytes:</t>

        <t>QueueSize (in bytes) = QueueSize (in sec) x Throughput (in
        bps)/8</t>

        <!-- <t>and 2) queue length in packets:</t>
        <t>QueueSize (in pkts) = QueueSize (in bytes)/MTU,
        MTU=1500</t> -->

        <!-- <t>[Open issue (11): Confirm the above values, do we need to
                        define parameters for other types of queues?]</t> -->

        <t>Long-lived TCP flows will download data throughout the session and
        are expected to have infinite amount of data to send or receive.</t>

        <t>Each short TCP flow is modeled as a sequence of file downloads
        interleaved with idle periods. Not all short TCPs start at the same
        time, i.e., some start in the ON state while others start in the OFF
        state.</t>

        <t>The short TCP flows can be modelled in two ways, 1) 100s of flows
        fetching small (5-20 KB) amounts of data, or 2) 10s of flows fetching
        slightly larger (100-1000KB) amounts of data.</t>

        <t>The idle period is typically derived from an exponential
        distribution with the mean value of 10 seconds.</t>
