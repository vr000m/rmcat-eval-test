Abstract

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transmit media in
   multimedia telephony applications, these applications are typically
   required to implement congestion control.  The RMCAT working group is
   currently working on candidate algorithms for such interactive real-
   time multimedia applications.  This document describes the test cases
   needed to evaluate the performance of those candidate algorithms.

1.  Introduction

   This memo describes a set of test cases for evaluating candidate
   RMCAT congestion control algorithm proposals, it is based on the
   guidelines enumerated in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria] and
   requirements discussed in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].  The test
   cases cover basic usage scenarios and are described using a common
   structure, which allows any implementer to provide new test cases to
   fit their test scenario and link characteristics.  Each test cases
   incorporates the metrics, evaluation guidelines and parameters
   described in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].

3.  Basic Structure of Test cases

   All test cases in this document follow a basic structure, it enables
   implementers to describe new test scenarios without explaining common
   attributes repeatedly.  The structure includes a general description
   section that describe the test case and motivations, additionally it
   defines a set of attributes that characterize the testbed, i.e., the
   network path between communicating peers and the diverse traffic
   sources.

   o  Define the test case:

      *  General description: describes the motivation and the goals of
         the test case.

      *  Additionally, describe the desired rate adaptation behaviour.

      *  Define a checklist to evaluate the desired behaviour: this
         indicates the minimum set of metrics that a proposed algorithm
         needs to measure to validate the expected rate adaptation
         behaviour.

   o  Define testbed attributes:

      *  Duration: defines the duration of the test case.

      *  Path characteristics: defines the transport level
         characteristics of a test case.  The characteristics describes
         two sets of characteristics, one each for the upstream and the
         downstream direction.  If only one is specified, it is used for
         both directions.

         +  Path direction: upstream or downstream.

         +  Number of bottlenecks and the link capacity for each
            bottleneck link.

         +  One-way propagation delay: describes the end-to-end latency
            along the path.

         +  Maximum end-to-end jitter: defines maximum jitter can be
            observed along the path.

         +  Bottleneck queue type: for example, Droptail, FQ-CoDel, or
            PIE.

         +  Bottleneck queue size: (in milliseconds).

         +  Link loss ratio: characterize the non-congested losses
            observed on a specific link, for e.g., at the access link or
            a bottleneck link.  Also describe the loss pattern or loss
            model.

      *  Application-related: defines the media-related behaviour for
         implementing the test case

         +  Media Source: defines the characteristics of the media
            sources present.  When using more than one media source, the
            different attributes are enumerated separately.

            -  Media flow direction: upstream, downstream or both.

            -  Number of media sources: defines the total number of
               media sources

            -  Media source configuration: describes the media encoder
               behavior.  This may include but not limited to

               o  Bit rate generation: Constant Bit Rate (CBR) if the
                  chosen media stream is produced at the exact rate as
                  the target bit rate.  Variable Bit Rate (VBR) if there
                  exits some variation at the media output bit rate than
                  the target bit rate for RMCAT media streams.

               o  If the media stream is sending VBR, the test case MUST
                  define the maximum and minimum encoding rate, frame
                  resolution, and frame rate.

               o  Variation from target bit rate: the encoder produces a
                  bit rate close to the target rate.  For example it may
                  vary between 5% to 15% above or below the target bit
                  rate.

               o  Encoder's responsiveness to a new bit rate request:
                  value typically between 10ms to 1000ms.

            -  Media content: describes the chosen media sequences; For
               example, test sequences are available at: [xiph-seq]
               [HEVC-seq].

            -  Media timeline: describes the point when the media source
               is introduced and removed from the testbed.  For example,
               the media source may begin transmitting when the test
               case begins or a few seconds after, etc.

            -  Startup behaviour: the media starts at a defined bit
               rate, which may be the minimum, maximum bit rate, or a
               value in between (in Kbps).

         +  Competing traffic source: describes the characteristics of
            the competing traffic source, the different types of
            competing flows are enumerated in
            [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].

            -  Traffic direction: Upstream, downstream or both.

            -  Number and Types of sources: defines the total number of
               competing sources of each type.  Types of competing
               traffic flows are listed in
               [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].  For example, the number
               of TCP flows connected to a web browser, the mean size
               and distribution of the content downloaded.

            -  Congestion control: enumerate the congestion control used
               by each type of competing traffic.

            -  Traffic timeline: describes when the competing is added
               and removed from the test case.

      *  Additional attributes: describes attributes essential for
         implementing a test case which are not included in the above
         structure.  These attributes MUST be well defined, so that
         other implementers are able to implement it.

   Any attribute can have a set of values (enclosed within "[]").  Each
   member value of such a set MUST be treated as different value for the
   same attribute.  This occurs when defining different attributes for
   the same type of traffic source.

   The test cases described in this document follow the above structure.

4.1.  Variable Available Capacity

   In this test case the end-to-end path capacity between the two
   endpoints varies over time.  This test is designed to measure the
   responsiveness of the candidate algorithm.  This test tries to
   address the requirement 1(a) in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements],
   which requires the algorithm to adapt the flow(s) and provide lower
   end-to-end latency when there exists:

   o  an intermediate bottleneck

   o  change in available capacity due to interface change and/or
      routing change.

   o  persistent network load due to competing traffic

   It should be noted that the exact variation in available capacity due
   to any of the above depends on the under-lying technologies.  Hence,
   we describe a set of known factors, which may be extended to devise a
   more specific test case targeting certain behaviour in a certain
   network environment.

   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithms is expected to detect the
   variation in available capacity and adapt the media stream(s)
   accordingly.  The candidate algorithm tracks the available capacity
   as closely as possible, i.e., if there is sufficient capacity the
   flow(s) reach their respective maximum bit rate.  When the available
   capacity drops, the flow(s) adapts by decreasing its bit rate, and
   when congestion disappears, the flow(s) are again expected to ramp
   up.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following
   metrics:

   1.  Flow level:

       a.  End-to-end delay

       b.  Losses observed at the receiving endpoint

       c.  Feedback message overhead

   2.  Transport level:

       a.  Bandwidth utilization

4.2.  Maximum Media Bit Rate is Greater than Link Capacity

   In this case, the application will attempt to ramp up to its maximum
   bit rate, since the link capacity is limited to a value lower, the
   congestion control is expected to stabilize the sending bit rate
   close to the available bottleneck capacity.  This situation can occur
   when the endpoints are connected via thin long networks even though
   the advertised capacity of the access network may be higher.  The
   test case addresses the requirement 1 and 10 of the
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm is expected to detect the
   limitation in available capacity and avoid future bit rate
   oscillations as it approaches the bottleneck link capacity.  The
   oscillations occur when the media flow(s) attempts to reach its
   maximum bit rate, overshoots the available bottleneck capacity
   causing overuse, to rectify it reduces the bit rate and starts to
   probe again.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following
   metrics:

   1.  Flow level:

       a.  End-to-end delay.

       b.  RTP packet losses observed at the receiving endpoint.

       c.  Variation in sending bit rate and goodput.  Mainly observing
           the frequency and magnitude of oscillations.

       d.  Convergence time.

       e.  Feedback message overhead.

      *  Media startup behaviour: [200Kbps, 1500Kbps].

      *  Competing traffic:

         +  Number of sources : Zero (0)

   o  Test specific setup: None

4.3.  Competing Flows with same RMCAT Algorithm

   In this test case, more than one RMCAT media flow shares the
   bottleneck link and use the same congestion control algorithm.  This
   is a typical scenario wherein a real-time interactive application
   sends more than one media flows to the same destination and these
   flows are multiplexed over the same port.  In such a scenario it is
   likely that the flows will be routed via the same path and need to
   share the available bandwidth amongst themselves.  For the sake of
   simplicity it is assumed that there are no other competing traffic
   sources in the bottleneck link and that there is sufficient capacity
   to accommodate all the flows.  While this appears to be a variant of
   the previous test case, however it tests the capacity sharing
   distribution of the candidate algorithm.  Whereas, the previous test
   case measures the stability of the candidate algorithm.  This test
   case particularly addresses the requirements 2,3 and 10 in
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   It is expected that the competing flows will converge to an optimum
   bit rate to accommodate all the flows with minimum possible latency
   and loss.  Specifically, the test introduces three media flows at
   different time instances, when the second flow appears there should
   still be room to accommodate another flow on the bottleneck link.
   Lastly, when the third flow appears the bottleneck link should be
   saturated.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following
   metrics:

   1.  Flow level:

       a.  End-to-end delay.

       b.  RTP packet losses observed at the receiving endpoint.

       c.  Variation in sending bit rate and goodput.  Mainly observing
           the frequency and magnitude of oscillations.

4.4.  RMCAT Flow competing with a long TCP Flow

   In this test case, one or more RMCAT media flow shares the bottleneck
   link with at least one long lived TCP flows.  Long lived TCP flows
   download data throughout the session and are expected to have
   infinite amount of data to send and receive.  This is a scenario
   wherein a multimedia application co-exists with a large file
   download.  The test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate
   algorithm to competing traffic, it addresses the requirements 8 in
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Depending on the convergence observed in test case 4.1 and 4.2, the
   candidate algorithm may be able to avoid congestion collapse.  In the
   worst case, the media stream will fall to the minimum media bit rate.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following
   metrics:

   1.  Flow level:

       a.  End-to-end delay for the RMCAT flow.

       b.  RTP packet losses observed at the receiving endpoint.

       c.  Variation in sending bit rate and goodput.  Mainly observing
           the frequency and magnitude of oscillations.

       d.  Variation in the sending rate of the TCP flow

       e.  TCP throughput.

       f.  Convergence time.

       g.  Feedback message overhead.

4.5.  RMCAT Flow competing with short TCP Flows

   In this test case, one or more RMCAT media flow shares the bottleneck
   link with at multiple short-lived TCP flows.  Short-lived TCP flows
   resemble the on/off pattern observed in the web traffic, wherein
   clients (browsers) connect to a server and download a resource
   (typically a webpage, few images, text files, etc.)  using several
   TCP connections (up to 4).  This scenario shows the performance of
   the multimedia application when several browser windows are active.
   The test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate algorithm to
   competing web traffic, it addresses the requirements 2 in
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Depending on the number of short TCP flows, the cross-traffic either
   appears as a short burst flow or resembles a long TCP flow.  The
   intention of this test is to observe the impact of short-term burst
   on the behaviour of the candidate algorithm.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following
   metrics:

   1.  Flow level:

       a.  End-to-end delay for the RMCAT flow.

       b.  RTP packet losses observed at the receiving endpoint.

4.6.  Congested Feedback Link

   RMCAT WG has been chartered to define algorithms for RTP hence it is
   assumed that RTCP, RTP header extension or such would be used as
   signalling means for the adaptation algorithm in the backchannel.
   Due to asymmetry nature of the link between communicating peers it is
   possible to observer lack such backchannel information due to
   impaired backchannel link (even when forward channel might be
   unimpaired).  This test case is designed to observer candidate
   congestion control behaviour in such an event.  This test case
   addresses requirement number 5 and in particular, requirement number
   7.

   It is expected that the candidate algorithms should cope will the
   lack of backchannel information and adapt to minimize the performance
   of media flows in the forward channel.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following
   metrics:

   1.  Flow level:

       a.  End-to-end delay

       b.  Losses observed at the receiving endpoint

       c.  Feedback message overhead

   2.  Transport level:

       a.  Bandwidth utilization

       b.  Queue length (ms)

           +  average over the length of the session

           +  5 and 95 percentile

   It should be noted that for this test case log is needed for the
   reference case where the downstream channel have no impairments.

         +  End behaviour: Bandwidth is restored to the 100% of

4.7.  Round Trip Time Fairness

   In this test case, more than one RMCAT media flow shares the
   bottleneck link, but the end-to-end path latency for each RMCAT flow
   is different.  For the sake of simplicity it is assumed that there
   are no other competing traffic sources in the bottleneck link and
   that there is sufficient capacity to accommodate all the flows.
   While this appears to be a variant of the test case 4.2, it tests the
   capacity sharing distribution of the candidate algorithm under
   different RTTs.  This test case particularly addresses the
   requirements 2 [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   It is expected that the competing flows will converge to an optimum
   bit rate to accommodate all the flows with minimum possible latency
   and loss.  Specifically, the test introduces five media flows at the
   same time instance.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following
   metrics:

4.8.  Media Pause and Resume

   In this test case, more than one real-time interactive media flows
   share the link bandwidth and all flows reach to a steady state by
   utilizing the link capacity in an optimum way.  At these stage one of
   the media flow is paused for a moment.  This event will result in
   more available bandwidth for the rest of the flows and as they are on
   a shared link.  When the paused media flow will resume it would no
   longer have the same bandwidth share on the link.  It has to make it
   way through the other existing flows in the link to achieve a fair
   share of the link capacity.  This test case is important specially
   for real-time interactive media which consists of more than one media
   flows and can pause/resume media flow at any point of time during the
   session.  This test case directly addresses the requirement number

   1.B in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].  One can think it as a
   variation of test case 4.3 however, it is different as the candidate
   algorithms can use different strategies to increase it s efficiency,
