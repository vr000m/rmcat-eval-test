   document provides a basic structure to escribe test cases, which can
   be customized by an implementer to fit their test scenario.

3.  Basic Structure of Test cases

   Defining a common structure enables implementers to describe new
   scenarios.

   o  Define the test case:

      *  General description: describes the motivation and the goals of
         the test case.

      *  Additionally, describe the desired rate adaptation behaviour.

      *  Define a checklist to evaluate the desired behaviour: this
         indicates the mimimum set of metrics that a proposed algorithm
         needs to achieve to pass the test case.

   o  Define testbed parameters:

      *  Duration: defines the duration of the test case.

      *  Path characteristics: defines the transport level
         characteristics of a test case.  The characteristics describes
         two sets of characteristics, one each for the upstream and the
         downstream direction.  If only one is specified, it is used for
         both directions.

         +  Path direction: upstream or downstream.

         +  Number of bottlenecks and the link capacity for each
            bottleneck link.

         +  One-way propagation delay: describes the end-to-end latency
            along the path.

         +  Maximum end-to-end jitter.

         +  Bottleneck queue type: for example, droptail, FQ-CoDel, or
            PIE.

         +  Bottleneck queue size in miliseconds.

         +  Link loss ratio: chatacterize the non-congested losses
            observed on a specific link, for e.g., at the access link or
            bottleneck link.  Also describe the loss pattern or model to
            implement the losses.

      *  Application-related: defines different applications behaviour
         included in the test case

         +  Media Source: defines the characteristics of the media
            sources present in the test case.  When using more than one
            media source, the following set of attibutes are defined for
            each such media source.

            -  Media flow direction: upstream, downstream or both.

            -  Number of media sources: defines the total number of
               media sources

            -  Media source configuration: describes the media encoder
               behavior.  This may include but not limited to

               o  Bit rate generation: Constant bit rate if the chosen
                  media stream is not congestion controlled (for
                  example, IPTV).  Variable bit rate for RMCAT media
                  streams.

               o  If the media stream is sending VBR, the test case MUST
                  define the maximum and minimum encoding rates, frame
                  resolution, and frame rate.

               o  Variation from target bit rate: the encoder produces a
                  bit rate close to the tartget rate.  For example it
                  may vary between 5% to 15% above or below the target
                  bit rate.

               o  Encoder's responsiveness to a new bit rate request:
                  value typically between 10ms to 1000ms.

            -  Media content: describes the chosen media sequences; For
               example, the desired frame rate, resolution, etc.  Test
               sequences are available at: [xiph-seq] [HEVC-seq].

            -  Media timeline: describes the point when the media source
               is introduced and removed from the network.  For example,
               the media source may begin transmitting when the test
               case begins or a few minutes after, etc.

            -  Startup behaviour: the media starts at a defined bit
               rate, which may be the minimum, maximum bit rate, or a
               value in between (in kbps).

         +  Competing traffic source : describes the characteristics of
            the competing traffic source, the different types of
            competing flows are enumerated in
            [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].

            -  Traffic direction: Upstream, downstream or both.

            -  Number and Types of sources: defines the total number of
               competing sources of each type.  Types of competing
               traffic flows are listed in
               [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].  For example, the number
               of TCP flows connected to a web browser, the mean size
               and distribution of the content downloaded.

            -  Congestion control: enumerate the congestion control used
               by each type of competing traffic.

            -  Traffic timeline: describes when the competing is added
               and removed from the test case.

      *  Additional attributes: describes attributes essential for
         implementing a test case which are not included in the above
         structure.  These attributes MUST be well defined, so that
         other implementers are able to implement it.

   The test cases described in this document follow the above structure.

4.  Basic Test Cases

4.1.  Variable Available Capacity

   In this test case the end-to-end path capacity between the two
   endpoint varies over time.  This test is designed to measure the
   responsiveness of the candidate algorithm.  The test tries to address
   the requirement 1(a) in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements], which
   requires the algorithm to adapt the flow(s) and provide lower end-to-
   end latency when there exists:

   o  an intermediated bottleneck

   o  change in available capacity due to interface change and/or
      routing change.

   o  persistent network load due to competing traffic

   It should be noted that the exact variation in available capcity due
   to any of the above impairments depends on the under-lying
   technology.  Hence, we describe a set of known factors, which may be
   extended to devise a more specific test case.

   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm should detect the
   variation and adapt the media stream accordingly.  The candidate
   algorithm track the available capacity as closely as possible, i.e.,

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT           February 2014


   if there is sufficient capacity the flow(s) reach their respective
   maximum bit rate.  When the available capacity drops, the RMCAT
   flow(s) adapts by decreasing its bit rate, and when congestion
   disappears, the flow(s) are expected to reach their maximum bit rate.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following
   metrics:

   1.  Flow level

       A.  End-to-end delay

       B.  Losses observed at the receiving endpoint

       C.  Feedback message overhead

   2.  Transport level

       A.  Bandwidth utilization

       B.  Queue length (ms)

           +  average over the length of the session

           +  5 and 95 percentile

   Testbed parameters:

   o  Test duration: 60s

   o  Path characteristics

      *  Path direction: Upstream and downstream.

      *  Number of bottlenecks : One.

      *  Bottleneck link capacity : 2Mbps.

      *  Bottleneck queue type: Drop tail.

      *  Bottleneck queue size: 300ms.

      *  Link loss ratio: 0%.

   o  Application-related

      *  Media Source:

         +  Media direction: Upstream.

         +  Number of media sources: two (2).

         +  Encoder configuration:

            -  Bit rate generation: VBR

            -  Bit rate range: 150kbps-1.5mbps

            -  Frame Resolution: 144p-720p (or 1080p)

            -  Frame rate: 10fps-30fps

            -  Variation from target bitrate: +/-5%

            -  Responsiveness to new bit rate request: 60ms

         +  Media content: Foreman media sequence

         +  Media timeline: all sources appear at start up, end 1s
            before shutdown.

      *  Media startup behaviour: starts at minimum bit rate (200kbps).

         +  Sequence number: 1

         +  Path direction: Upstream

         +  Amount of change: 50% of bottleneck link speed

         +  Duration: 5s

         +  start time: 10s

         +  end behaviour: bandwith is restored to the 80% of bottleneck
            link speed

      *  Link vairation pattern:

         +  Sequence number: 2

         +  Path direction: Upstream

         +  Amount of change: 50% of bottleneck link speed

         +  Duration: 10s

         +  starttime: 30s

         +  end behaviour: bandwith is restored to the 100% of
            bottleneck link speed

4.2.  Maximum Media Bit Rate is Greater than Link Capacity

   In this case, the application will attempt to reach its maximum bit
   rate, since the link capacity is limited to a value lower, the
   congestion control is expected to stabilize the sending bit rate
   close to the available bottleneck capacity.  This can occur when the
   endpoints are connected via thin Internet pipes eventhough the
   advertised capacity of the access network may be higher.  The test
   case addresses the requirement 1 and 10 of the
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   In this test case the canidate algorithm is expected to detect the
   limitation in available capacity and avoid bit rate oscillations as
   it approaches the bottleneck link capacity.  The oscillations occur
   when the media flow(s) attempts to reach its maximum bit rate,
   overshoots causing overuse, then reduces the bit rate and starts to
   probe again.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following
   metrics:

   1.  Flow level

       A.  End-to-end delay.

       B.  RTP packet losses observed at the receiving endpoint.

       C.  Oscillation in sending bit rate.

         at maximum bit rate.

      *  Competing traffic

   o  Test specific setup: none

4.3.  Competing with similar RMCAT flows

   In this test case, more than one RMCAT media flow shares the
   bottleneck link and use the same congestion control algorithm.  This
   is a typical scenario wherein a real-time interactive application
   sends more than one media flows to the same desitination and these
   flows are multiplexed over the same port.  In such a scenario it is
   likely that the flows will be routed via the same path and need to
   share the available bandwidth amongst themselves.  For the sake of
   simplicity it is assumed that there are no other competing taffic
   sources in the bottleneck link and that there is sufficient capacity
   to accomodate all the flows.  While this appears to be a variant of
   the previous test case, however it tests the capacity sharing
   distribution of the candidate algorithm.  Whereas, the previous test
   case measures the stability of the candidate algorithm.  This test
   case particularly addresses the requirements 2,3 and 10 in
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   It is expected that the competing flows will converge to an optimum
   bit rate to accomodate all the flows with minumum possible latency
   and loss.  Specifically, the test introduces three media flows at
   different time instances, when the second flow appears there should
   still be room to accomodate another flow on the bottleneck link.
   Lastly, when the third flow appears the bottleneck link should be
   saturated.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following
   metrics:

   1.  Flow level

       A.  End-to-end delay.

       B.  RTP packet losses observed at the receiving endpoint.

       C.  Oscillation in sending bit rate.

       D.  Convergence period.

4.4.  RMCAT Flow competing with a long TCP Flow

   In this test case, one or more RMCAT media flow shares the bottleneck
   link with at least one long lived TCP flows.  Long lived TCP flows
   download data throughout the session and are expected to have
   infinite amount of data to send and receive.  This is a scenario
   wherein a multimedia application co-exists with a large file
   download.  The test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate

   algorithm to competing traffic, it addresses the requirements 8 in
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Depending on the convergence observed in test case 4.1 and 4.2, the
   candidate algorithm may be able to avoid congestion collapse.  In the
   worst case, the media stream will fall to the minimum media bit rate.

   metrics:

4.5.  RMCAT Flow competing with short TCP Flows

   In this test case, one or more RMCAT media flow shares the bottleneck
   link with at multiple short-lived TCP flows.  Short-lived TCP flows
   resemble the on/off pattern observed in the web traffic, wherein
   clients (browsers) connect to a server and download a resource
   (typically a webpage, few images, text files, etc.) using several TCP
   connections (up to 4).  This scenario shows the performance of the
   multimedia application when several browser windows are active.  The
   test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate algorithm to
   competing web traffic, it addresses the requirements 2 in
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Depending on the convergence observed in test case 4.1 and 4.2, the
   candidate algorithm may be able to avoid congestion collapse.  In the

4.6.  Congested Feedback Link

   RMCAT WG has been chartered to define algorithms for RTP hence it is
   assumed that RTCP, RTP header extention or such would be used as
   signalling means for the adaptation algorithm in the backchannel.
   Due to assymetry nature of the link between communicating peers it is
   possible to observer lack such backchannel information due to
   impaired backchannel link (even when forward channel might be
   unimpaired).  This test case is designed to observer candidate
   congestion control behaviour in such an event.  This test case
   addresses requirement number 5 and in particular, requirement number
   7.

   It is expected that the candidate algorithms should cope will the
   lack of backchannel information and adapt to minimize the performace
   of media flows in the forward channel.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following
   metrics:

   1.  Flow level

       A.  End-to-end delay

       B.  Losses observed at the receiving endpoint

       C.  Feedback message overhead

   2.  Transport level

4.7.  Round Trip Time Fairness

   In this test case, more than one RMCAT media flow shares the
   bottleneck link, but the end-to-end path latency for each RMCAT flow
   is different.  For the sake of simplicity it is assumed that there
   are no other competing taffic sources in the bottleneck link and that
   there is sufficient capacity to accomodate all the flows.  While this
   appears to be a variant of the test case 4.2, it tests the capacity
   sharing distribution of the candidate algorithm under different RTTs.
   This test case particularly addresses the requirements 2
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   It is expected that the competing flows will converge to an optimum
   bit rate to accomodate all the flows with minumum possible latency
   and loss.  Specifically, the test introduces five media flows at the
   same time instance.

4.8.  Media Pause and Resume

   In this test case, more than one real-time interactive media flows
   share the link bandwidth and all flows reach to a steady state by
   utilizing the link capacity in a optimum way.  At these stage one of
   the media flow is paused for a moment.  This event will result in
   more available bandwidth for the rest of the flows and as they are on
   a shared link those available bandwidth will also be shared among the

   rest of the flows.  When the paused media flow will resume it would
   no longer have the same bandwidth share on the link.  Hence has to
   make it way through the other existing flows in the link to achieve a
   fairshare of the link capacity.  This test case is important
   specially for real-time interactive media which consists of more than
   one media flows and can pause/resume media flow at any point of time
   during the session.  This test case directly addresses the
   requirement number 1.B in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].  One can
   think it a variation of test case 4.3 however, it is different as the
   candidate algorithms can use different strategies to increase the
   fairness, convergence time and fairness of the fact that they have
   previous information of the link.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metics:

   1.  Flow level

       A.  End-to-end delay.

       B.  RTP packet losses observed at the receiving endpoint.

4.9.  Startup Behavior

   In this test case, more than one RMCAT media flow shares the
   bottleneck link, but they start at different start rates and there
   are no other competing taffic sources in the bottleneck link.  While
   this appears to be a variant of the test case 4.2, it tests the
   rampup and capacity sharing of the candidate algorithm when starting
   at different rates.  This test case particularly addresses the
   requirements 3 and 10.  [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   It is expected that the competing flows will converge to an optimum
   bit rate to accomodate all the flows with minumum possible latency
   and loss.  Specifically, the test introduces five media flows at the
   same time instance, but with differrent start rates.
