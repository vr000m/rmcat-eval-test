    <abstract>
      <t>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transmit media in
      multimedia telephony applications, these applications are typically
      required to implement congestion control. This document describes the
      test cases to be used in the performance evaluation of such congestion
      control algorithms.</t>

      <!--The draft defines a structure on how to define test cases and uses
	  that stracture to define test case those are essensial to RMCAT to evaluate
	  the candidate algorithms. also the intention here is define the test cases
	  in such a way that people can customize by tunning the same test case to fit
	  their to be tested network characteristics. this is the theme and we need
	  more text here.-->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This memo describes a set of test cases for evaluating congestion
      control algorithm proposals for real-time interactive media. It is based
      on the guidelines enumerated in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria"></xref> and the requirements
      discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements"></xref>. The
      test cases cover basic usage scenarios and are described using a common
      structure, which allows for additional test cases to be added to those
      described herein to accommodate other topologies and/or the modeling of
      different path characteristics. The described test cases in this memo
      SHOULD be used to evaluate any proposed congestion control algorithm for
      real-time interactive media.</t>

    <section anchor="TS" title="Structure of Test cases">
      <t>All the test cases in this document follow a basic structure allowing
      implementers to describe a new test scenario without repeatedly
      explaining common attributes. The structure includes a general
      description section that describes the test case and its motivation.
      Additionally the test case defines a set of attributes that characterize
      the testbed, for example, the network path between communicating peers
      and the diverse traffic sources.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Define the test case: <list style="symbols">
              <t>General description: describes the motivation and the goals
              of the test case.</t>

              <t>Expected behavior: describes the desired rate adaptation
              behavior.</t>

              <t>Define a list of metrics to evaluate the desired behavior:
              this indicates the minimum set of metrics (e.g., link
              utilization, media sending rate) that a proposed algorithm needs
              to measure to validate the expected rate adaptation behavior. It
              should also indicate the time granularity (e.g., averaged over
              10ms, 100ms, or 1s) for measuring certain metrics. Typical
              measurement interval is 200ms.</t>

              <!-- we agreed this should be 200ms or was it based on some IPPM doc? -->
            </list></t>

          <t>Define testbed topology: every test case needs to define an
          evaluation testbed topology. <xref target="fig-eval-topo"></xref>
          shows such an evaluation topology. In this evaluation topology,
          S1..Sn are traffic sources. These sources generate media traffic and
          use either congestion control algorithm under investigation. R1..Rn
          are the corresponding receivers. A test case can have one or more
          such traffic sources (S) and their corresponding receivers (R). The
          path from the source to destination is denoted as "forward" and the
          path from a destination to a source is denoted as "backward". The
          following basic structure of the test case has been described from
          the perspective of media generating endpoints attached on the
          left-hand side of <xref target="fig-eval-topo"></xref>. In this
          setup, the media flows are transported in forward direction and
          corresponding feedback/control messages are transported in the
          backward direction. However, it is also possible to set up the test
          with media in both forward and backward directions. In that case,
          unless otherwise specified by the test case, it is expected that the
          backward path does not introduce any congestion related impairments
          and has enough capacity to accommodate both media and
          feedback/control messages. It should be noted that depending on the
          test cases it is possible to have different path characteristics in
          either of the directions.<figure anchor="fig-eval-topo"

            </figure>In a testbed environment where real equipments are used
          to create a laboratory, there may exist a significant amount of
          traffic on portions of the network path between the endpoints that
          is not desired for the purposes of the tests described in the
          document. Some of this traffic may be generated by other processes
          on the endpoints themselves (e.g., discovery protocols) or by other
          endpoints not presently under test. It is recommended not to route
          traffic generated by endpoints that are not under test through the
          test bed and route those traffic generated by the endpoints under
          test around the bottleneck links specified herein.</t>

              Two sets of attributes describe the path characteristics, one
              for the forward path and the other for the backward path. The
              path characteristics for a particular path direction is
              applicable to all the Sources "S" sending traffic on that path.
              If only one attribute is specified, it is used for both path
              directions, however, unless specified the reverse path has no

        responsiveness of the candidate algorithm. This test tries to address
        the requirements in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements"></xref>, which requires the
        algorithm to adapt the flow(s) and provide lower end-to-end latency

            <t>an intermediate bottleneck</t>

            <t>change in available capacity (e.g., due to interface change,

            congestion control scheme is expected to stabilize the sending bit
            rate close to the available bottleneck capacity.</t>

        extended to devise a more specific test case targeting certain
        behaviors in a certain network environment.</t>

        <t>Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm is expected to detect
        the path capacity constraint, converges to the bottleneck link's
        capacity and adapt the flow to avoid unwanted oscillation when the
        sending bit rate is approaching the bottleneck link's capacity. The
        oscillations occur when the media flow(s) attempts to reach its
        maximum bit rate but overshoots the usage of the available bottleneck
        capacity then to rectify, it reduces the bit rate and starts to ramp
        up again.</t>

               title="Congested Feedback Link with Bi-directional Media Flows">
        <t>Real-time interactive media uses RTP hence it is assumed that RTCP,
        RTP header extension or such would be used by the congestion control
        algorithm in the backchannel. Due to asymmetric nature of the link
        between communicating peers it is possible for a participating peer to
        not receive such feedback information due to an impaired or congested
        backchannel (even when the forward channel might not be impaired).
        This test case is designed to observe the candidate congestion control
        behavior in such an event.</t>

        <t>It is expected that the candidate algorithms are able to cope with
        the lack of feedback information and adapt to minimize the performance
        degradation of media flows in the forward channel.</t>

        <t>It should be noted that for this test case: logs are compared with
        the reference case, i.e, when the backward channel has no
        impairments.</t>

        <t>Evaluation metrics : as described in <xref target="EM"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Testbed topology: One (1) media source S1 is connected to
        corresponding R1, but both endpoints are additionally receiving and
        sending data, respectively. The media traffic (S1-&gt;R1) is
        transported over the forward path and corresponding feedback/control
        traffic is transported over the backward path. Likewise media traffic
        (S2-&gt;R2) is transported over the backward path and corresponding
        feedback/control traffic is transported over the forward path.</t>

               title="Competing Media Flows with same Congestion Control Algorithm">
        <t>In this test case, more than one media flows share the bottleneck
        link and each of them uses the same congestion control algorithm. This
        is a typical scenario where a real-time interactive application sends
        more than one media flow to the same destination and these flows are
        multiplexed over the same port. In such a scenario it is likely that
        the flows will be routed via the same path and need to share the
        available bandwidth amongst themselves. For the sake of simplicity it
        is assumed that there are no other competing traffic sources in the
        bottleneck link and that there is sufficient capacity to accommodate
        all the flows individually. While this appears to be a variant of the
        test case defined in <xref target="VACM"></xref>, it focuses on the
        capacity sharing aspect of the candidate algorithm. The previous test
        case, on the other hand, measures adaptability, stability, and
        responsiveness of the candidate algorithm.</t>

        <t>Expected behavior: It is expected that the competing flows will
        converge to an optimum bit rate to accommodate all the flows with
        minimum possible latency and loss. Specifically, the test introduces
        three media flows at different time instances, when the second flow
        appears there should still be room to accommodate another flow on the
        bottleneck link. Lastly, when the third flow appears the bottleneck
        link should be saturated.</t>

        <t>Evaluation metrics : as described in <xref target="EM"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Testbed topology: Three media sources S1, S2, S3 are connected to
        R1, R2, R3 respectively. The media traffic is transported over the
        forward path and corresponding feedback/control traffic is transported
        over the backward path. <figure anchor="fig-eval-topo-4-3"

      <section title="Media Flow Competing with a Long TCP Flow">
        <t>In this test case, one or more media flows share the bottleneck
        link with at least one long lived TCP flow. Long lived TCP flows
        download data throughout the session and are expected to have infinite
        amount of data to send and receive. This is a scenario where a
        multimedia application co-exists with a large file download. The test
        case measures the adaptivity of the candidate algorithm to competing
        traffic. It addresses the requirement 3 in <xref

        <t>Expected behavior: depending on the convergence observed in test
        case 5.1 and 5.2, the candidate algorithm may be able to avoid
        congestion collapse. In the worst case, the media stream will fall to
        the minimum media bit rate.</t>

      <section title="Media Flow Competing with Short TCP Flows">
        <t>In this test case, one or more congestion controlled media flow
        shares the bottleneck link with multiple short-lived TCP flows.
        Short-lived TCP flows resemble the on/off pattern observed in the web
        traffic, wherein clients (browsers) connect to a server and download a
        resource (typically a web page, few images, text files, etc.) using
        several TCP connections (up to 4). This scenario shows the performance
        of a multimedia application when several browser windows are active.
        The test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate algorithm to
        competing web traffic, it addresses the requirements 1.E in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Depending on the number of short TCP flows, the cross-traffic
        either appears as a short burst flow or resembles a long TCP flow. The
        intention of this test is to observe the impact of short-term burst on
        the behavior of the candidate algorithm.</t>

      <section title="Media Pause and Resume">
        <t>In this test case, more than one real-time interactive media flows
        share the link bandwidth and all flows reach to a steady state by
        utilizing the link capacity in an optimum way. At this stage one of
        the media flows is paused for a moment. This event will result in more
        available bandwidth for the rest of the flows as they are on a shared
        link. When the paused media flow resumes it would no longer have the
        same bandwidth share on the link. It has to make it's way through the
        other existing flows in the link to achieve a fair share of the link
        capacity. This test case is important specially for real-time
        interactive media which consists of more than one media flows and can
        pause/resume media flows at any point of time during the session. This
        test case directly addresses the requirement number 5 in <xref

        variation of test case defined in <xref

        candidate algorithms can use different strategies to increase its
        efficiency, for example in terms of fairness, convergence time, reduce
        oscillation etc, by capitalizing the fact that they have previous

    <section title="Other potential test cases">
      <t>It has been noticed that there are other interesting test cases
      besides the basic test cases listed above. In many aspects, these
      additional test cases can help further evaluation of the candidate
      algorithm. They are listed as below.</t>

      <section title="Media Flows with Priority">
        <t>In this test case media flows will have different priority levels.
        This will be an extension of <xref
        target="competing-rmcat-flow"></xref> where the same test will be run
        with different priority levels imposed on each of the media flows. For
        example, the first flow (S1) is assigned a priority of 2 whereas the
        remaining two flows (S2 and S3) are assigned a priority of 1. The
        candidate algorithm MUST reflect the relative priorities assigned to
        each media flow. In the previous example, the first flow (S1) MUST
        arrive at a steady-state rate approximately twice of that of the other
        two flows (S2 and S3).</t>

        <t>The candidate algorithm can use a coupled congestion control
        mechanism for the bandwidth distribution according to the respective
        media flow priority.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Explicit Congestion Notification Usage">
        <t>This test case requires to run all the basic test cases with the
        availability of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) <xref
        target="RFC6679"></xref> feature enabled. The goal of this test is to
        exhibit that the candidate algorithms do not fail when ECN signals are
        available. With ECN signals enabled the algorithms are expected to
        perform better than their delay based variants.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Multiple Bottlenecks">
        <t>In this test case one congestion controlled media flow, S1-&gt;R2,
        traverses a path with multiple bottlenecks. As illustrated in <xref

        competes with the second congestion controlled media flow (S2-&gt;R2)
        over the link between A and B which is close to the sender side;
        again, that flow (S1-&gt;R1) competes with the third congestion
        controlled media flow (S3-&gt;R3) over the link between C and D which
        is close to the receiver side. The goal of this test is to ensure that
        the candidate algorithms work properly in the presence of multiple
        bottleneck links on the end to end path.</t>

        <t>Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm is expected to achieve
        full utilization at both bottleneck links without starving any of the
        three congestion controlled media flows.</t>
