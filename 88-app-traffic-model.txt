To model the intrinsic variability of video.

- what target bit rates can be achieved? (max?, min?)
- how much variability in media bit rate for a given target bit rate
- how to model motion?
- capturing high motion leads to higher than target bit rate, but by how much?

On responsiveness to a new target bitrate:

- how quickly can the codec generate a lower bit rate?
- immediately? does this depend on what is the new or requested rate?
- what is immediately? is it next frame or a few frames later, until then
  generates the current rate?
- if not immediately, what bitrates (and duration) will it generate before
  meeting the target bitrate.


- how quickly can the codec generate a higher bit rate?
- immediately in the next frame? does this depend on the new or requested rate?
- not immediately but in steps of intermediate bitrates, i.e., intermediate
  bitrate for a short duration then an increase in step, repeating until
  reaching the target bit rate.

- if the target bit rate is achieved in steps, can they be announced to the
  congestion controller apriori.

- If the media bit rate has not yet reached the requested target bit rate and
  the congestion control requests a new target bit rate, how does the codec
  respond?

Application design related:
- should the congestion control be able to change the frame rate (video) or
  packetization time (audio)
- should the congestion control be able to change video resolution?
- should error-repair: NACKs, FEC be considered part of congestion control or
  outside it, i.e., it is something that the application does and not
  congestion control
- If FEC is controlled by the congestion control, how quickly can the sending
  rate be adapted by reducing/adding redundancy (FEC)? is something link this
  done? Does this makes sense at all?
- Apart from loss and RTT, what other congestion cues are currently used by
  congestion control algorithms? e.g., Decoding rate/goodput, application
  decode error rate, ECN, PCN, etc.
- If the codec is data limited, i.e., producing a sending rate smaller than the
  one calculated by the congestion control, can the congestion control probe
  the bandwidth by sending additional data packets in a certain pattern (e.g.,
  PathChirp)? would something link this help?
- application input on prioritization: audio vs video (vs data)
