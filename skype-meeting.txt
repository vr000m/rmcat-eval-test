- Xiaoqing: to setup webpage/wiki to create simulation/emulation scenarios
- Xiaoqing: to share media generator for NS-2
- Varun: pick some reference video YUV files for emulation

My comments:
- low delay scenario: start rate? queue-size?
- is this media limited or does the traffic generator create full traffic?
- OWD is it sync'ed clocks between the endpoints? or relative to the first packet?
- Do you want to extract the results or just refer to them?

Changing: experiments to scenarios.

TODO: 
- traffic generators, how do we generate video flows.
- startup behaviour?
- parameter table (losses, latency, capacity, queue size)
- cross-traffic (synchronized arrival, shifted arrival)
- Expected behaviour or results?

22 September
- 1hr call with zahed
- motivation of the test
- expected behaviour 
- pass or fail conditions
