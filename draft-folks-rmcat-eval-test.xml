    <section anchor="app-scenario-1" title="Proposal to evaluate 
    Self-fairness of RMCAT congestion control algorithm">
        
        <t>The goal of the experiment discussed in this section is to
        initially take out as many unknowns from the scenario. Later
        experiments can define more complex environments, topologies and
        media behavior. This experiment evaluates the performance of the
        RMCAT sender competing with other similar RMCAT flows (running the
        same algorithm or other RMCAT proposals) on the bottleneck link.
        There are up to 20 RMCAT flows competing for capacity, but the
        media only flows in one direction, from senders (S1..S20) to
        receivers (R1..R20) and the feedback packets flow in the reverse
        direction. </t>
        
        <t><xref target="fig-exp1" /> shows the experiment setup and it
        has subtle differences compared to the simple topology in <xref
        target="fig-eval-topo" />. Groups of 10 receivers are connected to
        the bottleneck link through two different routers (Router C and
        D). The rationale for adding these additional routers is to create
        two delay legs, i.e., two groups of endpoints with different
        network latencies and measure the performance of the RMCAT
        congestion control algorithm. If fewer than 10 sources are
        initialized, all traffic flows experience the same delay because
        they share the same delay leg. </t>
        
        
        <t>Router A has a single forward direction bottleneck link (i.e.,
        the bottleneck capacity and delay constraints applies only to the
        media packets going from the sender to the receiver, the feedback
        packets are unaffected). Hence, the Round-Trip Time (RTT) is
        primarily composed of the bottleneck queue delay and any forward
        path (propagation) latency. The main reason for not applying any
        constraints on the return path is to provide the best-case
        performance scenario for the congestion control algorithm. In
        later experiments, it is possible to add similar capacity and
        delay constraints on the return path.</t>

        <t>Loss impairments are applied at Router C and Router D, but only
        to the feedback flows. If the losses are set to 0%, it represents
        a case where the return path is over-provisioned for all traffic.
        In later experiments the loss impairments can be added to the
        media path as well. </t>
        
        
        <t> The media sources are configured to send infinite amount of
        data, i.e., the sources always have data to send and have no data
        limited intervals. Additionally, the media sources are always 
        successful in generating the media rate requested by the RMCAT 
        congestion control algorithm. In this experiment, we avoid the 
        potentially complicated scenario of using media traffic generators 
        that try to model the behavior of media codecs (mainly the 
        burstiness). </t>

        <section title="Media Traffic Generator">
        <t>The media source always generates at the rate requested by the
        congestion control and has infinite data to send. Furthermore, the
        media packet generator is subject to the following constraints:
        <list style="numbers">
            <t>It MUST emit a packet at least once per 100 ms time
            interval.</t>
            
            <t>For low media rate source: when generating data at a rate
            less than a maximum length MTU every 100 ms would allow (e.g.,
            120 kbps = 1500 bytes/packet * 10 packets/sec * 8 bits/byte),
            the RMCAT source must modulate the packet size (RTP payload
            size) of RTP packets that are sent every 100 ms to attain the
            desired rate.</t>
            
            <t>For high media rate sources: when generating data at a rate
            greater than a maximum length MTU every 100 ms would allow,
            the source must do so by sending (approximately) maximum MTU
            sized packets and adjusting the inter-departure interval to be
            approximately equal. The intent of this to ensure the data is
            sent relatively smoothly independent of the bit rate, subject
            to the first constraint.</t>

        throughputs: 200 kbps, 800 kbps, 1.3 Mbps and 4 Mbps.<vspace/>
        
        For example, experiments with five RMCAT flows with an 800

        <t>No unfairness is observed, i.e., at steady state each flow
        attains a throughput between [ B/(3*N), (3*B)/N ], where B is the
        link bandwidth and N is the number of flows.</t>

        mimic a wireless link layer (for e.g., WiFi, 3G, LTE).
        Additionally, only losses are applied to the reverse path

        <section title="Access Links">
            <t>The media senders and receivers are typically connected to 
            the bottleneck link, common access links are:
            <list style="numbers">
                <t>Ethernet (LAN)</t>
                <t>Wireless LAN (WLAN) </t>
                <t>3G/LTE</t>
            </list>
            [Open issue: point to a reference containing parameters or
            traces to model WLAN and 3G/LTE.]
            </t>
            
            <t>A real-world network typically consists of a mixture of
            links, the most important aspect is to identify the location
            of the bottleneck link. The bottleneck link can move from one
            node to another depending on the amount of cross-traffic or
            due to the varying link capacity. The design of the
            experiments should take this into account. In the simplest
            case the access link may not be the bottleneck link but an
            intermediate node.</t>
            
        </section>
        
        <section title="Example Bottleneck Link Parameters">

            <!-- The performance of the congestion control is measured in
            terms of unfairness (occupancy of the bottleneck link
            capacity), variation in end-to-end delay due to queuing
            (self-inflicted delay), etc. -->

            <t>The bottleneck link carries multiple flows, these flows may
            be other RMCAT flows or other types of cross-traffic. The
            experiments should dimension the bottleneck link based on the
            number of flows and the expected behavior. For example, if 5
            media flows are expected to share the bottleneck link equally,
            the bottleneck link is set to 5 times the desired transmission
            rate.</t>
            
            <t>If the experiment carries only media in one direction, then 
            the upstream (sender to receiver) bottleneck link carries
            media packets while the downstream (receiver to sender)
            bottleneck carries the feedback packets. The bottleneck link
            parameters discussed in this section apply only to a single
            direction, hence the bottleneck link in the reverse direction
            can choose the same or have different parameters.</t>
            
            <t>The link latency corresponds to the propagation delay of 
            the link, i.e., the time it takes for a packet to traverse the
            bottleneck link, it does not include queuing delay. In an
            experiment with several links the experiment should describe
            if the links add latency or not. It is possible for
            experiments to have multiple hops with different link
            latencies. Experiments are expected to verify that the
            congestion control is able to work in challenging situations,
            for example over trans-continental and/or satellite links. The
            experiment should pick link latency values from the following:
            
            <list style="numbers">
                <t>Very low latency: 0-1ms</t>
                <t>Low latency:  50ms </t>
                <t>High latency: 150ms </t>
                <t>Extreme latency: 300ms</t>
            </list></t>
            
            <!-- <t>[Editor's note: currently describes the latency for a 
            single link, instead of end-to-end delay. Which is preferred?
            or both?]</t> -->
            
            <t>Similarly, to model lossy links, the experiments can choose
            one of the following loss rates, the fractional loss is the
            ratio of packets lost and packets sent.
                <list style="numbers">
                <t>no loss: 0%</t>
                <t>1% </t>
                <t>5% </t>
                <t>10%</t>
                <t>20%</t>
            </list>
            These fractional losses can be generated using traces,
            Gilbert-Elliot model, randomly (uncorrelated) loss.</t>

        <section title="DropTail Router Queue Parameters"
        anchor="scen-queue">
            <t>The router queue length is measured as the time taken to
